# Euro Truck Simulator 2 MP API

## Get current playercount of the servers

You can get the current number of players by GETing ```api.ets2mpstats.com/mp/playercount``` or ```api.ets2mpstats.com/mp/playercount/text```, this will return respectively a JSON reply or a plain text reply.
**This API call is depricated, there is no plans on providing a replacement as it's pretty much useless, if you want to get this you can call ```api.ets2mp.com/servers``` instead.**
